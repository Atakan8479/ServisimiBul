## Verified Gate 2 evidence — 2026-10-12

- Branch: `codex/gate2-flyway-foundation`.
- V1 applied to a clean disposable PostgreSQL 17.4 database and recorded one successful Flyway history row.
- A second startup reported schema version 1 as current and applied no migration.
- Maven results: 1 test, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped; packaged build succeeded on Java 21.0.2.
- All four geography tables had RLS enabled and one `servisimibul_app`-only policy each.
- `servisimibul_app` had `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` only on the four tables, required identity-sequence access, and no `BYPASSRLS`.
- `anon` and `authenticated` had no table access. A rolled-back future-table probe confirmed neither role inherited table or sequence access from PostgreSQL default privileges.
- The disposable local cluster was stopped and deleted.
- PR #1 was merged as commit `37d77fd3b167bfa8b0f0ab34f5284d7d1c79180b` before the shared-database cutover.
- A separate `servisimibul_app` login was provisioned on Supabase with no superuser, database-creation, role-creation, or RLS-bypass capability; its restricted login was verified independently from the migration administrator.
- Immediately before cutover, all four existing geography tables were confirmed empty. Only `school`, `neighborhood`, `district`, and `province` were dropped, in one transaction and without `CASCADE`.
- Flyway applied V1 successfully to Supabase PostgreSQL 17.11. Hibernate `ddl-auto=validate` then completed through the restricted runtime connection.
- The final read-only Supabase audit confirmed one successful V1 history row, four empty RLS-enabled geography tables, four `servisimibul_app` policies, runtime CRUD grants, and no `anon` or `authenticated` read access.
- Flyway was disabled again in the ignored local `.env` after the controlled migration run. No credential values were printed or committed.
